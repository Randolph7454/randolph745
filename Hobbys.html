<h1>Lacrosse</h1>
Lacrosse is my favorite sport and also my favorite thing to do.
<br>
I have been playing lacrosse for 5 years now. I play the Goalie position.
<br>
I stand in front of the net and block shots from the opposing team.
<br>
In the Spring, I hope to play varsity lacrosse for HEHS,
<br>
